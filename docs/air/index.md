# Air and Climage

Goal 13. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Climate Action

We'll focus on loading from the GDC API with Python here in the "air" folder.

Examples of datacommons.org [API used in Python](https://docs.datacommons.org/api/python/)


[Observable data loaders- for Python?](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders) - mentions that Python data loader would be invoked before the md file build, and the md file can access the data generated from the Python data loader. 

Kargil adds: We want to get the input values from the user through our HTML, then pass them to the Python data loader and display that data on our front end.

Loren adds: We may need to find a hosted service like Streamlit to provide real-time server-side Python calls to the GDC API. Maybe Google offers a hosting process for server-side calls to their API. Would be cool to simply call a hosted Google Colab with a JSON REST query to get back results. Is that doable?
